Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Tilman Pfau who gave me the opportunity to work on this project and visit the vibrant Dysprosium group at the University of Stuttgart. I would also like to thank the members of the Dysprosium lab for making me feel at home during my visit. In particular, I would like to convey my sincere gratitude to Jens who was always present for me as a mentor, colleague and friend.

Back on campus, I would like to express my immense gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, for spending countless hours every week brainstorming new ideas and helping me out with the smallest of roadblocks in my thesis. I am also indebted to my fellow condensed matter theorists, Arka and Kunal for engaging in several nights of fruitful discussion.

None of this would have been possible without the constant support and banter from my closest friends, Aabhas, Aalhad, Dhruva, and Kunal, who helped me maintain my sanity through the ups and downs of this journey. Our late night discussions about each others work widened my perspective and motivated me to look for  different angles on the problems I faced in my project. I would also like to thank some fellow researchers across the globe, Jo√£o and Tomi for promptly returning my emails inquiring about their research.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for unconditionally supporting me through my research journey so far.
